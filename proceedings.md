## Book of abstracts

The **Book of Abstracts** is freely available (golden open access, CC BY-SA 4.0) since 26/08/2020 in Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4002961.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4002961).



## Conference proceedings

The proceedings will be published as open-access by [Archaeopress](https://www.archaeopress.com/), but we reserve also the possibility to evaluate other publishing houses. It is finally our firm intention to have the volume ready and available before the end of 2021.

The process of paper collecting and evaluating will be entirely managed through the [EasyChair platform](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=archeofoss2020). For guidance on the platform or technical issues please write to [emanuel.demetrescu@gmail.com](mailto:emanuel.demetrescu@gmail.com).

### Deadline

The papers must be sent by ~~**March 15, 2021**~~ **March 31st, 2021**.

Considering challenging time constraints, the delay in delivery may lead to the exclusion of the contribution from publication.

### Evaluation process

The papers will undergo a twofold review process. The first stage will be carried out by the editors and the Scientific Committee, which may require changes or additions to the text. This first evaluation step includes an assessment of all the products presented in the contributions (software, datasets, etc) to verify they are all openly licensed and that the source code/dataset is available and accessible. We recommend therefore to clearly state in the text the release license and the URLs where data or software can be accessed.

The second step of the evaluation is entrusted to an expert in the subject under consideration (peer-review).

### Editorial guidelines

**Language**: papers for the proceedings can be submitted in English (preferred) or Italian. Before submitting the texts, a linguistic review by a native speaker is strongly recommended.

**Abstract**: In any case, a short abstract (maximum 600 characters) in English must be included.

**Length**: Each paper must not exceed the maximum length of 20,000 characters including blank spaces, bibliography and captions.

**Images**: The text can be accompanied by up to 6 images, in a quality suitable for printing (300dpi). Images must be delivered as independent files and must always be accompanied by a caption (to be included at the end of the main text) with precise indication of the source. All authors must have the rights to reproduce the images. A release form covering text and images will be provided for the purpose.

**Bibliography**: for bibliographical references and citation lists the use of Chicago Manual of Style, Author year ([https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)) is required and the use of citation management systems such as Zotero or Mendeley is strongly recommended (in which case the bibliographical database must accompany the text). It is advisable to limit the use of footnotes as much as possible and to include bibliographical references in the text, in brackets (Author year system: e.g., Montalbano 2020).

**Affiliation**: Affiliation (when available) and an email address for each author is required.
