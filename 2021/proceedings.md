**Go to the call for papers and workshops on our [Homepage](./index)**

## Conference proceedings

The proceedings will be published as open-access by [?????](), but we reserve also the possibility to evaluate other publishing houses. It is finally our firm intention to have the volume ready and available before the end of 2022?.

The process of paper collecting and evaluating will be entirely managed through the [EasyChair platform](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=archeofoss2020). For guidance on the platform or technical issues please write to [ArcheoFOSS XV|2021 Organizing Committee](mailto:archeofoss@gmail.com).

### Evaluation process

The papers will undergo a twofold review process. The first stage will be carried out by the editors and the Scientific Committee, which may require changes or additions to the text. This first evaluation step includes an assessment of all the products presented in the contributions (software, datasets, etc) to verify they are all openly licensed and that the source code/dataset is available and accessible. We recommend therefore to clearly state in the text the release license and the URLs where data or software can be accessed.

The second step of the evaluation is entrusted to an expert in the subject under consideration (peer-review).

### Editorial guidelines

Precise information on future editorial guidelines will be provided shortly.
